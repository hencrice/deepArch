Demonstrations
==================
Apply my implementation of deep architectures on various data set.

Feedforward Neural Network
--------------------------
I use the data set in `Digit Recognizer <http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer>`_ competition on Kaggle, and achieved 97.371% accuracy on public test set. You can check out the demonstration in ipython notebook through ipython notebook viewer `here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/5990038>`_.
