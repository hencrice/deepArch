Terminologies
=============
Define some terminologies I used in this documentation and comments in source code.

1. Target(s) v.s. output(s): In supervised learning, outputs means the actual outputs of deep architectures (or sometimes refer to the actual output of a layer), and targets represent the ground truth labels for data.
2. Input(s): Refer to either inputs of a layer in deep architectures or the actual data inputs.
